== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the [More] label in 'link' return output of [scf-posts] short code? =

[scf-posts] offers `filter_label_more` filter, which can be used to override the default label for the link. See http://shortcodefactory.com/users-guide/scf-posts/ for details.

= Why [scf-register-link] is not showing a register link, while I am logged out? =

The "Register" link is not offered if the Administration > Settings > General > Membership: 'Anyone can register' box is not checked.

= Why [scf-register-link] is not working with WPMU? =

On WordPressMU, there is no /wp-register.php file, and /wp-login.php?action=register is not a valid registration form. Thus, wp_register function does not show a registration link.

= Does this plugin has a known conflict with Wordpress or other plugins? =

Although, we have tested it in very much detail. But technically, it shouldn’t create a conflict, since it does not try to change anything in the Wordpress System.

= What if I use another short code in [scf-allow]...[/scf-allow]? =

[scf-allow] supports "short code within short code", so your other short codes in an [scf-allow]...[/scf-allow] block are rendered pretty fine.

= How to add short code support in text widget? =

Simply add `add_filter('widget_text', 'do_shortcode');` in your active theme's functions.php file.
